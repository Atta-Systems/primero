Feature: Validate Date Field
  As an administrator, I want to validate that the date is a valid date even if in the correct format.
  
  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an admin with username "primero" and password "primero"
    When I access "cases page"
    And I press the "Create a New Case" button

  Scenario: As a logged in user, I create a case and validate the date field with invalid values
    And I press the "Basic Identity" button  
    And I fill in the following:
      | Date of Birth     | Invalid Date         |
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Please enter the date in a valid format (dd-mmm-yyyy)" on the page

  Scenario: As a logged in user, I create a case and validate the date field and allow different formats
    And I press the "Basic Identity" button  
    And I fill in "Date of Birth" with "12/02/2014"
    And I press the "Best Interest" button  
    And I fill in "Date of Recommendation" with "12 02 2014"
    And I fill in "Date of submission" with "12-02-2014"
    And I fill in "Date of Implementation" with "12/Feb/2014"
    And I fill in "Proposed Support" with "None"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Case record successfully created" on the page
