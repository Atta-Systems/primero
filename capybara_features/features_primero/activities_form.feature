Feature: Activities Form
  As a Social Worker, I want to fill in form information for children (individuals) in particular circumstances
  so that we can track and report on areas of particular concern.

  Scenario: As a logged in user, I should access the form section activities
    Given I am logged in as an admin with username "primero" and password "primero"
    When I access "form section page"
    And I press the "Activities" button
    Then I should see the following fields:
      | Is the Child in school or training?        |
      | Name of School                             |
      | If not, why not?                           |
      | If yes, what type of education?            |
      | If relevant, what level have they achieved?|
