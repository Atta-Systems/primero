Feature: Suspect Records

  As an admin
  I want to manage flagged records

  Background:

  Given I am logged in as an admin
  And the following children exist in the system:
     | name   | unique_id  | flag     | flag_message      | investigated |
     | Steve  | id_1  | true     | steve is dodgy    | false        |
     | Bob    | id_2  | true     | bob is dodgy      | false        |
     | Dave   | id_3  | true     | dave is dodgy     | true         |
     | George | id_4  | false    | nil               | false        |

  @wip
  Scenario: Admin user should see a link on the home page with the details of how many suspect records need attention
  When I am on the home page
  Then I should see "3 Records need Attention"

  Scenario: Admin user should only see flagged children which have not been investigated
  When I am on the child listing filtered by flag
  Then I should see "Steve"
  And I should see "Bob"
  And I should see "Dave"
  And I should not see "George"

  #Consider deleting this outright
  @wip
  Scenario: Admin should be able to mark suspect record as investigated
  When I am on the cases filtered by flag
  And I follow "id_1"
  Then I should see "Mark as Investigated"

  @javascript @wip
  Scenario: When an admin user marks a flagged record as investigated it should no longer appear on the suspect record page
  When I am on the cases filtered by flag
  And I follow "id_1"
  And I mark "Steve" as investigated with the following details:
    """
    I wouldn't worry about this guy
    """
  Then I should see "Mark as Not Investigated"

   #Consider deleting this outright
  @wip
  Scenario: Admin should be able to mark investigated record as not investigated
  When I am on the cases page
  And I follow "id_3"
  Then I should see "Mark as Not Investigated"

  Scenario: When a record is not flagged admin should not be able to mark as investigated or not investigated
  When I am on the cases page
  And I follow "id_4"
  Then I should not see "Mark as Investigated"
  And I should not see "Mark as Not Investigated"

  @javascript @wip
  Scenario: When I mark a record as investigated the change log should display a single entry for the change
  When I am on the cases filtered by flag
  And I follow "id_1"
  And I mark "Steve" as investigated with the following details:
    """
    I wouldn't worry about this guy
    """
  And I follow "Change Log"
  Then I should see "Record was marked as Investigated by admin belonging to UNICEF because: I wouldn't worry about this guy"

  @javascript @wip
  Scenario: When I mark a record as not investigated the change log should display a single entry for the change
  When I am on the cases page
  And I follow "id_3"
  And I mark "Dave" as not investigated with the following details:
    """
    I don't know what's going on with this record
    """
  And I follow "Change Log"
  Then I should see "Record was marked as Not Investigated by admin belonging to UNICEF because: I don't know what's going on with this record"
