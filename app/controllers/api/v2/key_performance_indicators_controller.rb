# Controller for Key Performance Indicator Metrics
#
# Making Changes:
#
#   KPIs exist as queries against Solr and Postgres. These queries make use
#   of Sunspot and ActiveRecord respectively. They reside either:
#
#   * in the appropriately named Controller method e.g.
#     Number of Incidents is found at
#     KeyPerformanceIndicatorsController#number_of_incidents
#   * in the associated Concern GBVKeyPerformanceIndicators under the
#     Searches Module.
#
# **This code is currently in flux** as the proper query technolog
# (Solr, Postgres) is yet to be solidified and the proper architecture is yet
# to be defined in totality.
#
class Api::V2::KeyPerformanceIndicatorsController < ApplicationApiController
  # This is only temporary to avoid double render errors while developing.
  # I looks like this method wouldn't make sense for the audit log to
  # write given that 'write_audit_log' required a record type, id etc.
  # This response doesn't utilize any type of record yet and so cannot
  # provide this information.
