                1. Rape—non-consensual penetration (however slight) of the vagina, anus or mouth with a penis or other body part. Also includes non-consensual penetration of the vagina or anus with an object. Examples can include but are not limited to: gang rape, marital rape, sodomy, forced oral sex. This type of GBV does not include attempted rape since no penetration has occurred.

                2. Sexual Assault—any form of non-consensual sexual contact that does not result in or include penetration. Examples can include but are not limited to: attempted rape, unwanted kissing, unwanted stroking, unwanted touching of breasts, genitalia and buttocks, and female genital cutting / mutilation. This type of GBV does not include rape since rape involves penetration.

                3. Physical Assault—physical violence that is not sexual in nature. Examples can include but are not limited to: hitting, slapping, choking, cutting, shoving, burning, shooting or use of any weapons, acid attacks or any other act that results in physical pain, discomfort or injury. This type of GBV does not include female genital cutting / mutilation, or honor killing.

                4. Forced Marriage—the marriage of an individual against her or his will.

                5. Denial of Resources, Opportunities or Services—denial of rightful access to economic resources/assets or livelihood opportunities, education, health or other social services. Examples can include but are not limited to: a widow prevented from receiving an inheritance, earnings taken by an intimate partner or family member, a woman prevented from using contraceptives, a girl prevented from attending school, etc. This type of GBV does not include reports of general poverty.

                6. Psychological/Emotional Abuse—infliction of mental or emotional pain or injury. Examples can include but are not limited to: threats of physical or sexual violence, intimidation, humiliation, forced isolation, stalking, verbal harassment, unwanted attention, remarks, gestures or written words of a sexual and/or menacing nature, destruction of cherished things, etc.
